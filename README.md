# CNN_object_detector
CNN are now a days being used in detecting objects in images, like sign boards in a road image, people in street views etc. This projects implements CNN as object detector. The trained model here identifies 4 objects in any image, namely, cats, dogs, horses and humans. The architecture of model is Convolution layer of 32 filters, Convolution layer of 32 filters, MaxPool layer of (2, 2), Dropout of 0.25, fully connected layer, Dense layer of 128 neurons, Dropout of 0.5,
Dense layer of no. total number of objects to take out output.
